#!/bin/bash
#
#   This script is designed to publish changes made in the build
#   environment to the production environment in a reproducible
#   and traceable way. The script does a number of things:
#
#   1. Sanity checks of current environment
#   2. Check to see that build spack.yaml and spack.lock are in sync
#   3. Check whether any changes need to be made to the public env
#   4. Sync build and public environment package installs
#   5. (Re)build the public module tree
#   6. Commit and push changes to Github repo
#
#   Note:   as of Spack v0.17, the activate scripts will break if
#           used with an environent already activated outside of a
#           shell script. So we must activate in the script!
